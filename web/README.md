## Contributing

**We heartily welcome any and all contributions that match our engineering standards!**

That being said, this codebase isn't your typical open source project because it's not a library or package with a limited scopeâ€”it's our entire product.

### Ground Rules

#### Reporting a bug or discussing a feature idea

If you found a technical bug on Say Their Names or have ideas for features we should implement, the issue tracker is the best place to share your ideas.

#### Fixing a bug or implementing a new feature

If you find a bug on Say Their Names and open a PR that fixes it we'll review it as soon as possible.

If you want to implement a new feature, open an issue first to discuss what it'd look like and to ensure it fits in our roadmap and plans for the app (see [the trello board](https://trello.com/b/8x3mo2V5/say-their-names-web) for planned and currently ongoing work).

Want to fix a bug or implement an agreed-upon feature? Great, jump to the [local setup instructions](#first-time-setup)!


### Codebase

#### Technologies

With the ground rules out of the way, let's talk about the core architecture of this mono repo:

- **Full-stack JavaScript**: We use strapi.io as our open-source headless CMS powered by GraphQL, and React to power our frontend. Almost all of the code you'll touch in this codebase will be JavaScript.


### First time setup

The first step to running Spectrum locally is downloading the code by cloning the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FranckNdame/say-their-names.git

```
### Start the backend server

```bash
cd backend

# Using yarn
yarn
yarn develop

# Using npm
npm install
npm run develop
```

### Start the frontend server

```bash
cd frontend

# Using yarn
yarn
yarn develop

# Using npm
npm install
npm run develop
```

React server is running here => [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
Strapi server is running here => [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337)

Let's have fun, let's make an impact.
